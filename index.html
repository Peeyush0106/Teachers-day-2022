            Dear Ma'am, <br>
            I am so glad that I am your student.
            You have enlit my life and boosted my caliber.
            What you teach, is not a subject, it is an aspect of life.
            Because you are never specific to a box.
            You made me think out of the box and always kept me on the correct path of life.
            It can't be expressed in words, but a relation between a teacher and a student, is never just for a time period, once a bond placed, it stays forever and never breaks.
            Thank you, for being my teacher.
            Thank you, for keeping me inspired and motivated, whatever the situation be.
